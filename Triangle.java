/*
1.Look at the results, does the output produced with a value of N = 5 match the following 
display?  
output : Each row  contains exactly  asterisks, from 1 to 5
2.If not, which parts should be improved or added? Describe any parts that need to be 
improved or added!
Since the output does match the expected left aligned triangle when n = 5, the program is functionally correct
